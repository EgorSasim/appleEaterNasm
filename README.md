## COMPILATION
U should have __nasm compiler__ on your computer. It's important!!!

Program **will work only** on **Linux system** with **i386** harware **architecture** or same.

So if U complete all conventions, just __run__ file, called __'runGame.sh'__.

Btw. 'runGame.sh' can accept __2 params__: __widht and height__ of playing field. So if U run __./runGame.sh 10 20__ U receive the field with width of 10 and length of 20 cells.

If U don't have linux with i386 or same, so... my condolences =(
## CONTROL
To manage main hero ("@" sign) press on of the 5 available buttons:
+ h -> go left 
+ j -> go down
+ k -> go up
+ l -> go right
and after that press Enter.

P.S.: U can combine available buttons. For example "hhhj + 'Enter'" move hero 3 times left and one time down.


Good luck and have a nice day!!!
